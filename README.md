_A web framework for structured, dynamic and maintainable applications_

## Project Overview

The Odoo Web Library (OWL) is a small
UI framework intended to be the basis for the [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) Web Client, and hopefully many
other Odoo related projects. OWL's main feature is a _declarative component system_, with QWeb as a template engine, asynchronous rendering, and an underlying virtual dom.

**Try it online!** An online playground is available at [https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground) to let you experiment with the OWL framework.

## OWL's Design Principles

OWL is designed to be used in highly dynamic applications where changing
requirements are common, code needs to be maintained by large teams.

- **XML based**: templates are based on the XML format, which allows interesting
  applications. For example, they could be stored in a database and modified
  dynamically with `xpaths`.
- **templates compilation in the browser**: this may not be a good fit for all
  applications, but if you need to generate dynamically user interfaces in the
  browser, this is very powerful. For example, a generic form view component
  could generate a specific form user interface for each various models, from a XML view.
- **no toolchain required**: this is extremely useful for some applications, if,
  for various reasons (security/deployment/dynamic modules/specific assets tools),
  it is not ok to use standard web tools based on `npm`.

Owl is not designed to be fast or small (even though it is quite good on those
two topics). If you are interested in a comparison with React or Vue, you will
find some more information [here](doc/comparison.md).

## Example

Here is a short example to illustrate interactive components:

```xml
<templates>
  <button t-name="Counter" t-on-click="increment">
    Click Me! [<t t-esc="state.value"/>]
  </button>
</templates>
```

```javascript
class Counter extends owl.Component {
  state = { value: 0 };

  increment() {
    this.state.value++;
  }
}

const qweb = new owl.QWeb(TEMPLATES);
const counter = new Counter({ qweb });
counter.mount(document.body);
```

Note that we assume here that the xml templates are available in the `TEMPLATES`
string. More interesting examples can be found on the
[playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground) application.

## Installing/Building

If you want to use a simple `<script>` tag, the last release can be downloaded here:

- [owl-0.15.0.js](https://github.com/odoo/owl/releases/download/v0.15.0/owl.js)
- [owl-0.15.0.min.js](https://github.com/odoo/owl/releases/download/v0.15.0/owl.min.js)

Some npm scripts are available:

| Command               | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`         | install every dependency required for this project                           |
| `npm run build`       | build a bundle of _owl_ in the _/dist/_ folder                               |
| `npm run minify`      | minify the prebuilt owl.js file                                              |
| `npm run test`        | run all tests                                                                |
| `npm run test:watch`  | run all tests, and keep a watcher                                            |
| `npm run tools`       | build tools applications, start a static server (see [here](doc/tooling.md)) |
| `npm run tools:watch` | same as `tools`, but with a watcher to rebuild owl                           |
