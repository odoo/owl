_Class based components with hooks, reactive state and concurrent mode_

**Try it online!** you can experiment with the Owl framework in an online [playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground).

## Project Overview

The Odoo Web Library (Owl) is a smallish (~<20kb gzipped) UI framework built by
[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) for its products. Owl is a modern
framework, written in Typescript, taking the best ideas from React and Vue in a
simple and consistent way. Owl's main features are:

- a declarative component system,
- a reactivity system based on hooks,
- concurrent mode by default,

Owl components are defined with ES6 classes and xml templates, uses an
underlying virtual DOM, integrates beautifully with hooks, and the rendering is
asynchronous.

Quick links:

- [documentation](#documentation),
- [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) (from Owl 1.x to 2.x),
- [playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground)

## Example

Here is a short example to illustrate interactive components:

```javascript
const { Component, useState, mount, xml } = owl;

class Counter extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <button t-on-click="() => state.value++">
      Click Me! [<t t-esc="state.value"/>]
    </button>`;

  state = useState({ value: 0 });
}

class App extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <div>
      <span>Hello Owl</span>
      <Counter />
    </div>`;

  static components = { Counter };
}

mount(App, document.body);
```

Note that the counter component is made reactive with the [`useState` hook](doc/reference/hooks.md#usestate).
Also, all examples here uses the [`xml` helper](doc/reference/tags.md#xml-tag) to define inline templates.
But this is not mandatory, many applications will load templates separately.

More interesting examples can be found on the
[playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground) application.
