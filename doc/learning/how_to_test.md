## Overview

It is a good practice to test applications and components to ensure that they
behave as expected. There are many ways to test a user interface: manual
testing, integration testing, unit testing, ...

In this section, we will discuss how to write unit tests for components.

## Unit Tests

Writing unit tests for Owl components really depends on the testing framework
used in a project. But usually, it involves the following steps:

- create a test file: for example `SomeComponent.test.js`,
- in that file, import the code for `SomeComponent`,
- add a test case:
  - create a real DOM element to use as test fixture,
  - create a test environment
  - create an instance of `SomeComponent`, mount it to the fixture
  - interact with the component and assert some properties.

To help with this, it is useful to have a `helper.js` file that contains some
common utility functions:

```js
export function makeTestFixture() {
  let fixture = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(fixture);
  return fixture;
}

export function nextTick() {
  let requestAnimationFrame = owl.Component.scheduler.requestAnimationFrame;
  return new Promise(function(resolve) {
    setTimeout(() => requestAnimationFrame(() => resolve()));
  });
}

export function makeTestEnv() {
    // application specific. It needs a way to load actual templates
    const templates = ...;

    return {
        qweb: new QWeb(templates),
        ..., // each service can be mocked here
    };
}
```

With such a file, a typical test suite for Jest will look like this:

```js
// in SomeComponent.test.js
import { SomeComponent } from "../../src/ui/SomeComponent";
import { nextTick, makeTestFixture, makeTestEnv} from '../helpers';


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Setup
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
let fixture: HTMLElement;
let env: Env;

beforeEach(() => {
  fixture = makeTestFixture();
  env = makeTestEnv();
  // we set here the default environment for each component created in the test
  Component.env = env;
});

afterEach(() => {
  fixture.remove();
});

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Tests
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
describe("SomeComponent", () => {
  test("component behaves as expected", async () => {
    const props = {...}; // depends on the component
    const comp = new SomeComponent(null, props);
    await comp.mount(fixture);

    // do some assertions
    expect(...).toBe(...);

    fixture.querySelector('button').click();
    await nextTick();

    // some other assertions
    expect(...).toBe(...);
  });
});
```

Note that Owl does wait for the next animation frame to actually update the DOM.
This is why it is necessary to wait with the `nextTick` (or other methods) to
make sure that the DOM is up-to-date.

It is sometimes useful to wait until Owl is completely done updating components
(in particular, if we have a highly concurrent user interface). This next
helper simply polls every 20ms the internal Owl task queue and returns a promise
which resolves when it is empty:

```js
function afterUpdates() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let timer = setTimeout(poll, 20);
    let counter = 0;
    function poll() {
      counter++;
      if (owl.Component.scheduler.tasks.length) {
        if (counter > 10) {
          reject(new Error("timeout"));
        } else {
          timer = setTimeout(poll);
        }
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }
  });
}
```
