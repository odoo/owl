## Overview

Every Owl application has a root element, a set of templates, an environment and
possibly a few other settings. The `App` class is a simple class that represents
all of these elements. Here is an example:

```js
const {Component, App } = owl;

class MyComponent extends Component { ... }

const app = new App(MyComponent, { props: {...}, templates: "..."});
app.mount(document.body);
```

The basic workflow is: create an `App` instance configured with the root
component, the templates, and possibly other settings. Then, we mount that
instance somewhere in the DOM.

## API

- **`constructor(Root[, config])`**: first argument should be a component class (not
  an instance), and the optional second argument is a configuration object (see below).

- **`mount(target, options)`**: first argument is an html element, and the optional
  second argument is an object with mounting options (see below). Mount the app
  to a target in the DOM. Note that this is an asynchronous operation: the `mount`
  method returns a promise that resolves to the component instance whenever it
  is complete.

  The `option` object is an object with the following keys:

  - **`position (string)`**: either `first-child` or `last-child`. This option determines
    the position of the application in the target: either first or last child.

- **`destroy()`**: destroys the application

## Configuration

The `config` object is an object with some of the following keys:

- **`env (object)`**: if given, this will be the shared `env` given to each component
- **`props (object)`**: the props given to the root component
- **`dev (boolean, default=false)`**: if `true`, the application is rendered in
  [`dev` mode](#dev-mode);
- **`test (boolean, default=false)`**: `test` mode is the same as `dev` mode, except
  that Owl will not log a message to warn that Owl is in `dev` mode.
- **`translatableAttributes (string[])`**: a list of additional attributes that should
  be translated (see [translations](translations.md))
- **`translateFn (function)`**: a function that will be called by owl to translate
  templates (see [translations](translations.md))
- **`templates (string | xml document)`**: all the templates that will be used by
  the components created by the application.
- **`getTemplate ((s: string) => Element | Function | string | void)`**: a function that will be called by owl when it
  needs a template. If undefined is returned, owl looks into the app templates.
- **`warnIfNoStaticProps (boolean, default=false)`**: if true, Owl will log a warning
  whenever it encounters a component that does not provide a [static props description](props.md#props-validation).
- **`customDirectives (object)`**: if given, the corresponding function on the object will be called
  on the template custom directives: `t-custom-*` (see [Custom Directives](templates.md#custom-directives)).
- **`globalValues (object)`**: Global object of elements available at compilations.

## `mount` helper

Note that there is a `mount` helper to do that in just a line:

```js
const { mount, Component } = owl;

class MyComponent extends Component {
    ...
}

mount(MyComponent, document.body, { props: {...}, templates: "..."});
```

Here is the `mount` function signature:

**`mount(Component, target, config)`** with the following arguments:

- **`Component`**: a component class (Root component of the app)
- **`target`**: an html element, where the component will be mounted as last child
- **`config (optional)`**: a config object (the same as the App config object)

Most of the time, the `mount` helper is more convenient, but whenever one needs
a reference to the actual Owl App, then using the `App` class directly is
possible.

## Roots

An application can have multiple roots. It is sometimes useful to instantiate
sub components in places that are not managed by Owl, such as an html editor
with dynamic content (the Knowledge application in Odoo).

To create a root, one can use the `createRoot` method, which takes two arguments:

- **`Component`**: a component class (Root component of the app)
- **`config (optional)`**: a config object that may contain a `props` object or a
  `env` object.

The `createRoot` method returns an object with a `mount` method (same API as
the `App.mount` method), and a `destroy` method.

```js
const root = app.createRoot(MyComponent, { props: { someProps: true } });
await root.mount(targetElement);

// later
root.destroy();
```

Note that, like with owl `App`, it is the responsibility of the code that created
the root to properly destroy it (before it has been removed from the DOM!). Owl
has no way of doing it itself.

## Loading templates

Most applications will need to load templates whenever they start. Here is
what it could look like in practice:

```js
// in the main js file:
const { loadFile, mount } = owl;

// async, so we can use async/await
(async function setup() {
  const templates = await loadFile(`/some/endpoint/that/return/templates`);
  const env = {
    _t: someTranslateFn,
    templates,
    // possibly other stuff
  };

  mount(Root, document.body, { env });
})();
```

## Dev mode

Dev mode activates some additional checks and developer amenities:

- [Props validation](./props.md#props-validation) is performed
- [t-foreach](./templates.md#loops) loops check for key unicity
- Lifecycle hooks are wrapped to report their errors in a more developer-friendly way
- onWillStart and onWillUpdateProps will emit a warning in the console when they
  take longer than 3 seconds in an effort to ease debugging the presence of deadlocks
