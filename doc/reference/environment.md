# ðŸ¦‰ Environment ðŸ¦‰

An environment is an object which contains a [`QWeb` instance](qweb.md). Whenever a root component is created, it is assigned an environment. This environment
is then automatically given to each sub component (and accessible in the `this.env` property).

```
    Root
    /  \
   A    B
```

This way, all components share the same `QWeb` instance.
