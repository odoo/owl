## Event Handling

In a component's template, it is useful to be able to register handlers on DOM
elements to some specific events. This is what makes a template _alive_. This
is done with the `t-on` directive. For example:

```xml
<button t-on-click="someMethod">Do something</button>
```

This will be roughly translated in javascript like this:

```js
button.addEventListener("click", component.someMethod.bind(component));
```

The suffix (`click` in this example) is simply the name of the actual DOM
event. The value of the `t-on` expression should be a valid javascript expression
that evaluates to a function in the context of the current component. So, one
can get a reference to the event, or pass some additional arguments. For example,
all the following expressions are valid:

```xml
<button t-on-click="someMethod">Do something</button>
<button t-on-click="() => this.increment(3)">Add 3</button>
<button t-on-click="ev => this.doStuff(ev, 'value')">Do something</button>
```

Notice the use of the `this` keyword in the lambda function: this is the
correct way to call a method on the component in a lambda function.

One could use the following expression:

```xml
<button t-on-click="() => increment(3)">Add 3</button>
```

But then, the increment function may be unbound (unless the component binds it
in its setup function, for example).

## Modifiers

In order to remove the DOM event details from the event handlers (like calls to
`event.preventDefault`) and let them focus on data logic, _modifiers_ can be
specified as additional suffixes of the `t-on` directive.

| Modifier   | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.stop`    | calls `event.stopPropagation()` before calling the method                                                                |
| `.prevent` | calls `event.preventDefault()` before calling the method                                                                 |
| `.self`    | calls the method only if the `event.target` is the element itself                                                        |
| `.capture` | bind the event handler in [capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) mode. |

```xml
<button t-on-click.stop="someMethod">Do something</button>
```

Note that modifiers can be combined (ex: `t-on-click.stop.prevent`), and that
the order may matter. For instance `t-on-click.prevent.self` will prevent all
clicks while `t-on-click.self.prevent` will only prevent clicks on the element
itself.

Finally, empty handlers are tolerated as they could be defined only to apply
modifiers. For example,

```xml
<button t-on-click.stop="">Do something</button>
```

This will simply stop the propagation of the event.
