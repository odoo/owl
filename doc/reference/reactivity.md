## Overview

Reactivity is a big topic in javascript frameworks. The goal is to provide a
simple way to manipulate state, in such a way that the interface automatically
update accordingly to state changes. Also, we obviously want this to happen in
a performant way.

To solve this issue, Owl provides two reactivity primitives:

- `reactive`, which returns a proxy to its first argument, and tracks all read/update
  operation going through it,
- `useState`: a hook, that internally uses `reactive`, and is linked to its
  owner component: any read operation will be tracked (key by key), and any
  updates to these tracked values will cause the component to be rerendered.

Most of the time, the `useState` hook is the best solution.

## `useState`

Let us start by an example of how `useState` could be used:

```js
class Counter extends Component {
  static template = xml`
    <div t-on-click="increment">
      <t t-esc="state.value"/>
    </div>`;

  setup() {
    this.state = useState({ value: 0 });
  }

  increment() {
    this.state.value++;
  }
}
```

If one were to use a simple state object, Owl would not be aware that the value
was changed and that the component should be rerendered. With the `useState`
hook, `this.state` is now a reactive object, so this component works as expected.

## `reactive`

The `reactive` function is the basic reactivity primitive. It takes an object
or an array as first argument, and optionally, a function as the second argument.
The function will be called whenever any tracked value is updated.

```js
const obj = reactive({ a: 1 }, () => console.log("changed"));

obj.a = 2; // does not log anything: the 'a' key was not read
console.log(obj.a); // log 2, and reads the 'a' key => it is now tracked
obj.a = 3; // log 'changed' because we updated a tracked value
```

An important property of reactive objects is that they can be reobserved: this
will create an independant proxy that tracks another set of keys:

```js
const obj1 = reactive({ a: 1, b: 2 }, () => console.log("observer 1"));
const obj2 = reactive(obj1, () => console.log("observer 2"));

console.log(obj1.a); // log 1, and reads the 'a' key => it is now tracked by observer 1
console.log(obj1.b); // log 2, and 'b' is now tracked by observer 1
console.log(obj2.b); // log 2, and 'b' is now tracked by observer 1
obj2.a = 3; // log 'observer1', because observer2 does not track a
obj2.b = 3; // log 'observer1' and 'observer2'
```

Obviously, one can use `reactive` on the result of a `useState` if wanted, this
is the proper way to watch for some state changes.
