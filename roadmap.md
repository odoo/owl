# 🦉 OWL Roadmap 🦉

- Current version: 1.0.0-beta1
- Status: mostly stable

This roadmap is only an attempt at predicting Owl's future.  Everything may
change!



### December 2019

If all goes well, Owl is upgraded to beta status. From now on, no API change,
even small, is expected (but it still could happen).

### End of 2019

Release v1.0

- API should be stable,
- we will use semantic versioning,
- we will maintain a changelog and an upgrade guide.

### 1.x

- add chrome and firefox devtools,
- add support for single file components,
- fix every bugs,
- improve documentation,
- small backward compatible improvements.

### 2.x (2021? 2022?)

Maybe:

- reimplement vdom to use *block* system, like Vue 3, which should make Owl
  much faster
- refactor `QWeb` to use an intermediate representation (some kind of AST) to
  allow additional optimisations.
