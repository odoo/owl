# ðŸ¦‰ OWL Roadmap ðŸ¦‰

- Current version: 1.0.5
- Status: stable

This roadmap is only an attempt at predicting Owl's future.  Everything may
change!


### 1.x

- add chrome and firefox devtools,
- fix every bugs,
- improve documentation,
- small backward compatible improvements.

### 2.x (2020? 2021? 2022?)

- stop support for `t-set` directive to define the content of a slot

Maybe:

- reimplement vdom to use *block* system, like Vue 3, which should make Owl
  much faster
- refactor `QWeb` to use an intermediate representation (some kind of AST) to
  allow additional optimisations.
