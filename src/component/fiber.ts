 * Owl Fiber Class

 * Fibers are small abstractions designed to contain all the internal state
 * associated with a "rendering work unit", relative to a specific component.
 *
 * A rendering will cause the creation of a fiber for each impacted components.
 *
 * Fibers capture all that necessary information, which is critical to owl
 * asynchronous rendering pipeline. Fibers can be cancelled, can be in different
 * states and in general determine the state of the rendering.
