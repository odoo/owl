 * The `Context` object provides a way to share data between an arbitrary number
 * of component. Usually, data is passed from a parent to its children component,
 * but when we have to deal with some mostly global information, this can be
 * annoying, since each component will need to pass the information to each
 * children, even though some or most of them will not use the information.
 *
 * With a `Context` object, each component can subscribe (with the `useContext`
 * hook) to its state, and will be updated whenever the context state is updated.

   * Instead of using trigger to emit an update event, we actually implement
   * our own function to do that.  The reason is that we need to be smarter than
   * a simple trigger function: we need to wait for parent components to be
   * done before doing children components.  The reason is that if an update
   * as an effect of destroying a children, we do not want to call the
   * mapStoreToProps function of the child, nor rendering it.
   *
   * This method is not optimal if we have a bunch of asynchronous components:
   * we wait sequentially for each component to be completed before updating the
   * next.  However, the only things that matters is that children are updated
   * after their parents.  So, this could be optimized by being smarter, and
   * updating all widgets concurrently, except for parents/children.
   *
   * A potential cheap way to improve this situation is to keep track of the
   * depth of a component in the component tree. A root component has a depth of
   * 1, then its children of 2 and so on... Then, we can update all components
   * with the same depth in parallel.
