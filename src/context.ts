 * annoying, since each component will need to pass the information to each
 * children, even though some or most of them will not use the information.
 *
 * With a `Context` object, each component can subscribe (with the `useContext`
 * hook) to its state, and will be updated whenever the context state is updated.

   * as an effect of destroying a children, we do not want to call any code
   * from the child, and certainly not render it.
   *
   * This method implements a simple grouping algorithm by depth. If we have
   * connected components of depths [2, 4,4,4,4, 3,8,8], the Context will notify
   * them in the following groups: [2], [4,4,4,4], [3], [8,8]. Each group will
   * be updated sequentially, but each components in a given group will be done in
   * parallel.
   *
   * This is a very simple algorithm, but it avoids checking if a given
   * component is a child of another.
