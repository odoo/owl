 *
 * Whenever you are notified of a change, all subscriptions are cleared, and if
 * you would like to be notified of any further changes, you should go read
 * the underlying data again. We assume that if you don't go read it again after
 * being notified, it means that you are no longer interested in that data.

 * Subscriptions:
 * + Reading a property on an object will subscribe you to changes in the value
 *    of that property.
 * + Accessing an object keys (eg with Object.keys or with `for..in`) will
 *    subscribe you to the creation/deletion of keys. Checking the presence of a
 *    key on the object with 'in' has the same effect.
 * - getOwnPropertyDescriptor does not currently subscribe you to the property.
 *    This is a choice that was made because changing a key's value will trigger
 *    this trap and we do not want to subscribe by writes. This also means that
 *    Object.hasOwnProperty doesn't subscribe as it goes through this trap.

 * @param callback the function to call when an observed property of the
