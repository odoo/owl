# Owl Devtools Chrome extension

This app contains the code for the owl devtools chrome extension. 
It is separated into the popup app and the devtools app. 

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also run:
```bash
npm run build:devtools
```
from the root of the owl repository to build the extension.

For production:
```bash
npm run build
```

To run the extension, go to your chrome extensions admin panel and click on `Load unpacked`.
Select your build folder (generated by rollup) and that's it, your extension is active! 
There is a convenient refresh button on the extension card (still on the same admin page) to update your code. 
Note you may have to open another window to see it working.
Also note that the extension will run properly only on pages that have this branch's version of owl.
