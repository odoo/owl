# Owl Devtools Browser extension

This app contains the code for the owl devtools browser extension. 
It is separated into the popup app and the devtools app. 

## Install

In the owl root folder:

```bash
npm install
```

For chrome:

```bash
npm run build:devtools-chrome
```

For firefox: 

```bash
npm run build:devtools-firefox
```

You can also run:
```bash
npm run dev:devtools-chrome
```
or
```bash
npm run dev:devtools-firefox
```
to avoid recompiling owl and gain time if it has already been done.

To run the extension:

In google chrome: go to your chrome extensions admin panel, activate developer mode and click on `Load unpacked`.
Select your build folder (generated by rollup) and that's it, your extension is active! 
There is a convenient refresh button on the extension card (still on the same admin page) to update your code. 
Do note that if you got some problems, you may need to completly remove and reload the extension to completly refresh the extension.

In firefox: go to the address about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox and click on `Load temporary Add-on...`.
Select any file of the build folder and that's it, your extension is active! 
Here, you can use the reload button to refresh the extension.

Note you may have to open another window or reload your tab to see the extension working.
Also note that the extension will run properly only on pages that have this branch's version of owl.
