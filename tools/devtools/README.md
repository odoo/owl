It is separated into the popup app and the devtools app.

npm run watch
```

For production:

To run the extension, go to your chrome extensions admin panel and click on `Charger l'extension non empaquet√©e`.
Select your build folder (generated by rollup) and that's it, your extension is active! 
There is a convenient refresh button on the extension card (still on the same admin page) to update your code. 
Note you may have to open another window to see it working.
